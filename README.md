## What's Flats _6_?

Delivering the update we never had :on


## What's Flats?
Flats is an FPS with several different game modes to play either alone or online against other players. You can even play in local multiplayer matches with friends using the same WiFi network.

Among the game modes for both the single and multiplayer games are classics like Death Match, Team Death Match, Capture the Flag, and Zombie Mode. And if this isn't enough variety for you, there are also a dozen different weapons available to play with.

One of the most compelling things about Flats is that the game has no textures. Everything in the game – the settings as well as the characters and weapons – has a solid color. This gives the game a unique look ... and also makes it flow very smoothly. Plus in the customization options, you can pick the color you want your character to be.

Flats is a terrific first-person shooter that stands out not just for its alluring graphics but also for its many game modes and an enormous variety of weapons. And of course, it's super fun and offers really solid controls.
